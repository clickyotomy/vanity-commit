vanity-commit
-------------

Make a 'git commit' with a prefix for the commit hash you like.

usage: commit.py [-h] -p PREFIX [-d]

Create vanity commits with a prefix you want.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PREFIX, --prefix PREFIX
                        a valid hexadecimal prefix
  -d, --debug           enable debugging

CAVEATS
    [+] Lengthy hash prefixes will take longer amounts of compute time.

How does it work?
    Tries to append the commit message with a random string and computes the
    hash. This is done in a brute-force way. The script runs in loop till a
    suitable hash (with the given prefix) is found.
